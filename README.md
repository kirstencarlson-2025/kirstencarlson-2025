# Hi! I'm Kirsten
🎓 Undergraduate at Arizona State University, expected to graduate December 2025
<br>🌴 Studying: Conservation Ecology and Biology
<br>
<br>🪸 Current project:
<br>~ Analyzing coral/Symbiodiniaceae genomic datasets (2bRAD/ITS2)
<br>~ Learning high-performance computing workflows (SLURM, bash scripting)
<br>
<br>🌎 I hope to join a collaborative research community where I can explore coral biodiversity, learn new analytical approaches, and contribute to solutions for reef conservation in a changing climate.
